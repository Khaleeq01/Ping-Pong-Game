# Ping-Pong-Game
A Ping Pong game project 
1. There will be 2 rods at the top and bottom of the screen.
2. Both rods will be controlled with the same keys. In other words, they will move together.
3. When the game starts, an alert should be shown about the highest score and the player who scored it. If there is no such record, say 'this is your first time'.
4. If the score becomes highest, then store the name and max-score in local storage.
5. After every round, when one wins an alert will be displayed showing the winning player and his score.
